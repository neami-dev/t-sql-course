 Important: There is No For Loop or Do While Statement In T-SQL

There is No For loop or Do .. While loop In T-SQL

In T-SQL (Transact-SQL, used with Microsoft SQL Server), 
    there are no FOR or DO WHILE statements as you would find in many other programming languages. 
    The primary looping constructs available in T-SQL are the WHILE loop and the CURSOR, 
    which is used to iterate over a result set row by row.

Only WHILE Loop
The WHILE loop is the primary means for performing repeated actions in T-SQL and it works similarly to WHILE loops in other programming languages.
 It executes a block of statements as long as a specified condition is true.
