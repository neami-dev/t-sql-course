Transactions in T-SQL:

Introduction to Transactions

    Definition: A transaction in SQL is a series of database operations that are treated as a 
    single logical unit. It ensures that either all operations within it are executed or none are.
    ACID Properties: Transactions in SQL adhere to ACID properties - Atomicity, Consistency,
    Isolation, Durability.

Why Use Transactions?
    Data Integrity: Critical for operations that must not be partially completed, such as bank 
    transfers.
    Error Handling: Transactions help in managing errors and maintaining database 
    consistency.

ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It's a set 
of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.

1- Atomicity: This ensures that all operations within a transaction are treated as a single unit. Either all of them    are executed successfully, or none are. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back (undone), maintaining data integrity.

2- Consistency: Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. Integrity constraints are maintained so that the database remains consistent before and after the transaction.

3- Isolation: Isolation ensures that transactions are securely and independently processed at the same time without interference, but the results of the transaction are as if the transactions were processed sequentially. This prevents transactions from reading intermediate (and possibly inconsistent) data.

4- Durability: Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure. This means that the changes made by the transaction are permanently stored in the database. In practical terms, this means that the database system has mechanisms in place, such as writing to a transaction log, that ensure the permanence of the transaction's effects.
