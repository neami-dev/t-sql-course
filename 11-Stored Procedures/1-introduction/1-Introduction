Stored Procedures in T-SQL
Introduction to Stored Procedures
Stored procedures in T-SQL are a powerful feature of SQL Server.
They allow you to encapsulate SQL code, which can be executed repeatedly. Stored procedures are beneficial 
for several reasons:
    Performance: They are compiled and stored in the database, leading to faster 
    execution times.
    Security: They provide an additional layer of security by restricting direct 
    access to the data.
    Maintainability: Centralizing business logic in stored procedures makes changes easier 
    and more consistent.
